national election poll results evaluation

Exit pollsters predict election results before final counts are tallied by sampling voters leaving voting locations.  The pollsters have no way of selecting a random sample, so they instruct their interviewers to select every third exiting voter, of fourth, or tenth, or some other specified number.  Some voters refuse to participate of avoid the interviewer.  If the refusers and avoiders have the same voting patterns as the rest of the population, then it shouldn’t matter; the sample, although not random, wouldn’t be biased.  If, however, one candidate’s voters are more likely to refuse or avoid interview, the sample would be biased and could lead to misleading conclusion.  

On November 4, 2004, exit pollsters incorrectly predicted that John Kerry would win the U.S. presidential election over George W. Bush.  The exit polls overstated the Kerry advantage in 42 of 50 states.  No one expects exit polls to be exact, but chance alone cannot reasonable explain this discrepancy.  Although fraud is a possibility, the data are also consistent, with Bush supports being more likely than Kerry supporters to refuse or avoid participation in the exit poll.  

In a postelection evaluation, the exit polling agency investigated voter avoidance of interviewers.  Display 7.21 shows the average Kerry exit poll overestimate (determined after the actual counts were available) for a large number of voting precincts, grouped according to the distance of the interviewer from the door.  If Bush voters were more likely to avoid interviews in general, one might also expect a greater avoidance with increasing distance to the interviewer (since there is more opportunity for escape).   

A positive relationship between distance of the interviewer from the door and amount of Kerry overestimate, therefore, would lend credibility to the theory that Bush voters were more likely to avoid exit poll interviews.  How strong is the evidence that the mean Kerry overestimate increases with increasing distance of interviewer from the door?
